# Information and Features
This project is a simulation of an online commerce website. The landing page and item detail page are both built dynamically with data from a sql server database, cookies are utilized to preserve the state of the shopping cart between sessions, and a confirmation email is sent upon order completion.

Note: All utilized images were retrieved from Google Images, all item descriptions were compiled from various vehicle information websites, and all data collected during checkout is used purely for confirmation email purposes.
